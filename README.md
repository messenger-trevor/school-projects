# Spring and Angular Hotel running in Docker: Includes Docker screenshot

This was a full stack application for my university performance assessment wherein I demonstrate the ability to build and pass data between a Java/Spring back end
and an Angular frontend. The frontend was not designed by me and built using a walkthrough supplied by my university, then modified by me to include CRUD functionality and added logic for
backend services.  I built the backend and added logic for handling resource bundling for time, language, and currency, and then was required to launch all resource bundles
concurrently using java threads. Some config files that were supplied by the university have been omitted.

Below is a screenshot correctly showing the application running in a container and being exposed on port:8080. I built my docker image off an openJDK version.
